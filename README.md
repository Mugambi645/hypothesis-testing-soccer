# Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

- The hypothesis test conducted in the code provided is a Mann-Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric(data is not normally distributed) statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the distributions of two independent groups.

- The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the central tendency (typically the median) between the two groups being compared. In this case, it would imply that the distribution of goals scored by men is equal to that of women.

- The alternative hypothesis posits that there is a difference in the central tendency between the two groups. In the context of the analysis, it suggests that one group (women) scores significantly more goals than the other group (men).
- This indicates a right-tailed test since we are specifically looking for evidence that women's scores are greater than men's.
## Results
- Reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is statistically significant evidence to support that women score more goals than men on average in FIFA World Cup matches.This is because the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (pâ‰¤0.01):
